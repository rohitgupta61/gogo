# How to increase Retention?

Retention is the percentage of users who come back to the game again after installation after a given time period. For example, if D1 is 30%, 30% of the users come back again on the next day of installation. 

LTV is a key KPI for measuring the game performance. LTV is a function of Retention and Monetisation. Out of two, retention is a primary KPI as we can figure out how to make money from retaining users. If there is no retained user, there is no money. 

Increasing it depends following three things

1. Users should like the game 
2. Users should think of coming back again to the game
3. Users should return to the game
